/**
 * Topology-mutation converge spine (OPR.0.3.3.24, AC-6 scaffold).
 *
 * The reconciler model is: diff(declaredSpec, liveTopology) -> Op[]; converge(op)
 * applies each supported op. This release IMPLEMENTS one op — `add_member` —
 * built on the extracted create-node + launch-binding primitives. The Op union
 * is COMPLETE-shaped (all reshape kinds typed) and the differ CLASSIFIES the
 * full set, but the identity-migrating kinds (remove/move/fork/change_runtime)
 * are CLASSIFIED-deferred to the 0.4.0 identity theme: they migrate or clone an
 * existing seat's identity (logical-id re-key + continuity_state migration +
 * queue re-route), which add_member deliberately does not.
 *
 * This is a SCAFFOLD, not a reconciler build: there is no `rig apply` loop here
 * (that is a design sketch this release). converge() never silently skips an
 * unsupported op — it reports it honestly as "detected, not yet supported".
